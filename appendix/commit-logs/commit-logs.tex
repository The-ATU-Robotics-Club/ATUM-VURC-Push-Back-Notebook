\appendix{Commit Logs}
This appendix contains the commit log (version history) of this notebook, the
CAD, and the code. Automated commits (such as how these commit history tables
are updated) have been filtered for easier reading. Other commits such as merges
or reverts may also be omitted. The username section for the notebook is very misleading, 
since these commits were made using Overleaf and therefore use the "author" (owner) of the 
document (Jhon Perez).
